!Series_summary	"Meningiomas account for roughly one-third of all primary brain tumors. Although typically benign, about 20% of meningiomas are aggressive, and despite the rigor of the current histopathological classification system, there  remains considerable uncertainty in predicting tumor behavior. Here we analyzed 160 tumors from all three WHO grades (I-III) using clinical, gene expression and sequencing data. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified three molecular groups that reliably predicted clinical severity. These groups did not directly correlate with the WHO grading system, which would classify more than half of the tumors in the most aggressive molecular group as benign. Transcriptional and biochemical analyses revealed that aggressive meningiomas involve loss of the repressor function of the DREAM complex, resulting in cell cycle activation, and only tumors in this group tend to recur after full resection. These findings should improve our ability to predict recurrence and develop targeted treatments for these clinically challenging tumors."
